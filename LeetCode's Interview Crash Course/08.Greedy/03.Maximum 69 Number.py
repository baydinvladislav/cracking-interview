# You are given a positive integer num consisting only of digits 6 and 9.
# Return the maximum number you can get by changing at most one digit (6 becomes 9, and 9 becomes 6).

# Example 1:
# Input: num = 9669
# Output: 9969
# Explanation:
# Changing the first digit results in 6669.
# Changing the second digit results in 9969.
# Changing the third digit results in 9699.
# Changing the fourth digit results in 9666.
# The maximum number is 9969.

# Example 2:
# Input: num = 9996
# Output: 9999
# Explanation: Changing the last digit 6 to 9 results in the maximum number.

# Example 3:
# Input: num = 9999
# Output: 9999
# Explanation: It is better not to apply any change.
